    <h2 >Who am I?</h2>
    <p>GEOFFREY SAKORA</p>
    <p>Aliases: Jeff, Sir Geoff, bezosonfleek</p>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic IT student and always on the lookout for anything interesting in tech.
       I have experience in two fast-moving companies and one remote, accumulating to almost a one-year experience.
       I believe I am an asset wherever I go and always on the lookout to solve problems and contribute to success of teams
       and also my individual success.
    </p>
    <h2 class="tektur-font">Extra</h2>
    <p>Beside my interest in tech, I have an almost similar passion for sports especially football.
       It helps me keep myself in shape physically, emotionally and most importantly mentally.
    </p>
